# D3D12Rendering

This is my repository for my D3D12 Rendering/DXR Raytracing project. This is for educational purposes only.

The purpose of this project is to gain familiarity with the DirectX 12 API and to serve as an introduction into the basics of Raytracing.

Code base is largely formed through referencing a few sources listed below:

3DGEP's D3D12 Tutorials - https://www.3dgep.com/learning-directx-12-1/#Introduction

Nvidia's DXR introductory tutorials - https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/raytracing/dxr/dx12-raytracing-tutorial-part-1

Paul Varcholik's DirectX Essentials LiveLesson Framework - https://bitbucket.org/pvarcholik/directx-essentials-livelessons/src/master/
